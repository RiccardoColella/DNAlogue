# DNALogue
Chatbot aiming to translate Natural Language to GMQL.

## Hou to install
`$> npm start` for installing all the dependencies

## Getting started
`$> npm start` for starting the server
After starting the server you can access two pages. The first one for a user interface:
```sh
127.0.0.1:4500
```
While the second is for the wizard interface:
```sh
127.0.0.1:4500/wizard
```
Try to text between the two pages ;)
